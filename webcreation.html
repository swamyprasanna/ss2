                The first generation Classic 350 
                and the Classic 500 feature the
                new unit construction engine in
                    their 350cc and 500cc <br> variants 
                    respectively. However the Classic
                    350 uses a carburettor for fuel 
                    delivery and the Classic 500 has
                    EFI.<br> The Classic 350 has an
                    ammeter while the Classic 500 has a
                    low fuel 
                    indicator light and engine 
                    check light instead of the ammeter

                    The bike was designed at Royal Enfield's Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire, 
                    England. <br>Both models, Interceptor and Continental GT, share the same engine, frame, suspension, wheels, brakes,
                     exhausts and silencers. <br>
                    The engine is a wet-sump, 648 cc, air-cooled SOHC, 8v, parallel twin. 
                    Fuelling is via Bosch injection and engine management.<br> The low 9.5:1 compression ratio will help the engine
                     tolerate lower-octane fuel. The crankshaft has a 270Â° Crank, with a gear-driven <br> balance shaft ahead of the crank.

                The Royal Enfield Himalayan was conceived by CEO Siddhartha Lal, as an adventure touring, or dual sport motorcycle.
                 The Himalayan differs considerably from the other motorcycles offered by Royal Enfield - most of which are various 
                incarnations of the Bullet utilising the same frame and engine - in terms of its chassis and powertrain.
